    "\n",
    "In Python, a List is a class in Python that stores values in the form of integers, decimals, strings, or other lists. It is imporant because it allows an easy \"random access\" of items if we know the index position of the item. It is also a relatively easy data structure to wrap your head around (imo)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important things to keep in mind: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can add an element to the end of an arraywith O(1) complexity if the array is not full. (If you don't know yet, read more about complexity in this great medium article: https://medium.com/fintechexplained/time-complexities-of-python-data-structures-ddb7503790ef ) However, if the array is full, the entire value of the array must be shifted to add an extra element, hence adding an element comes with O(N) complexity in that case. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Notice that here we can see a clear trade-off between time and space complexity as if we initially store a large size array using higher space complexity, accessing its elements becomes easier with O(1) complexity and vice versa.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- We can insert an element with O(n) complexity (worst case) as we will have to shift all the values of the array one position below in order to accomodate for the new position of the new element. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- While removing items, if the last item needs to be removed, it is very convenient as it can be simply done in O(1) time complexity. However, if an arbitrary indexed item needs to be removed, it will tak eO(n) complexity as the other items will have to be shifted in position, and the indexed item will also have to be searched for in the array.
